Started work on my Texas Hold 'em game and the most important logic is the algorithm that determines whose hand wins.

12/4/2024: First half is done. It detects the type of winning hands a player has. I need to optimize this now. Then I would need to see what winning hands are on the community cards. Then the last part is to compare the hands of each player as well as the community.
